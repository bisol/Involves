# Pojomizer
A simple Java lib to convert POJOs to CSV format.
Developed as an interview challenge.

## Design considerations
The challenge specification can be found on [desafio_java.pdf] (desafio_java.pdf) (portuguese). 
It leaves a few points open, and I was instructed to follow my heart :) 
So, here goes my take on it:
- What is an attribute: This an OOP concept that is not specifically defined in Java, and can be interpreted as 'property', 'field', or even 'public field. I have defined it as any data field of a class.   
- How to handle a list of POJOs of different classes: One approach would be to throw an error. I choose to add columns for every attribute found, reusing columns for fields with the same name but from different classes. This may result on a column having values of different types (eg, double and text), which may or may not be useful.   
- What is a complex object: does String count? What about enums and primitive wrappers? I choose to support primitive types, their wrappers, String and enums.
- How to handle *null* values: One might write *"null"*, or an empty string. I went with the empty string.

## Building
You must have Maven and a JDK (minimum 1.7) installed.
As a Maven project, your IDE should be able to handle the building process. 
Or, on a terminal, go to the project root and type:
```
mvn clean install
```

## Usage
### Instantiating the lib
Nothing fancy here:
```
Pojomizer pojomizer = new Pojomizer();
```
### Configuration
All these steps are optional.
#### Configuring the character set to use when writing to the output  
```
pojomizer.setCharset("latin1"); // default is "utf8"
```
#### Configuring the serialization strategy to use 
Currently only supports CSV serialization. This is a placeholder for future expansions.
```
pojomizer.setStrategy(Pojomizer.SERIALIZATION_TARGET_CSV); // default is SERIALIZATION_TARGET_CSV
```
#### Controlling log output
```
pojomizer.setLogLevel(Level.FINE); // default is INFO  
```
### Serializing Objects
There are a number of options here.

To serialize a single POJO to a file:
```  
File target = getFile();// your code here
Object pojo = getPojo();// your code here
OutputStream os = pojomizer.serializePojosToFile(target, pojo);
os.close(); // weird specification requisite
```

To serialize a Collection of POJOs to a file:
```  
File target = getFile();// your code here
Collection<Object> pojos = getPojos();// your code here
OutputStream os = pojomizer.serializePojosToFile(target, pojos);
os.close(); // weird specification requisite
```

We can also use arrays
```  
File target = getFile();// your code here
Object[] pojos = getPojos();// your code here
OutputStream os = pojomizer.serializePojosToFile(target, pojos);
os.close(); // weird specification requisite
```

Or supply our own OutputStream
```  
Object[] pojos = getPojos();			// your code here
OutputStream os = getOutputStream();// your code here
pojomizer.serializePojosToStream(os, pojos);
os.close();
```
